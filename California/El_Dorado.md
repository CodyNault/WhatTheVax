We have administered nearly 18,000 doses as of February 3, 2021.
We expect a shipment from the State of 975 Pfizer and 1900 Moderna doses next week. Please note, doses that have not yet been administered are being held for already-scheduled appointments through mid-February. I would check this website Feb 12th since it seems like appointments usually open 3 days out 
Looks like you can call (530) 295-410 to get help with an appointment
