Here are some other info sites to check often as things keep changing.

https://covidvaccine.oregon.gov/

https://govstatus.egov.com/or-oha-covid-resources

I check for changes on this page a lot.  Changes pop up almost weekly.    https://covidvaccine.oregon.gov/#prioritization

I have personally found the SEIU503 union site the most informative for home caregivers and DDS support workers:   https://seiu503.org/member_news/coronavirus-resources-for-seiu-members/

******This is the number one best info with contact phone numbers and links for Oregon counties to get registered for vaccine clinics. Itâ€™s the SEIU503 union site for all counties in Oregon:   https://seiu503.org/county-covid-19-vaccine-clinics/
