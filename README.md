# What The Vax

### Why we exist
This shouldnt even be a thing but here we are. For some reason it seemed like a good idea to leave every county to figure out distribution on their own.
Now there are thousands of different portals for registering for the vaccine, each with their own problems. 

### Why our website is on GitHub
This way anyone with moderate technical skill can contribute what tips they have found for registering for vaccines in their county
