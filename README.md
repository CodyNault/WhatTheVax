# What The Vax

### Why This Exists
This shouldnt even be a thing but here we are. For some reason The United States decided to let every state decide how to ditribute the Covid vaccines and then most states decided to let the Counties figure it out on their own. Because of this there are now thousands of different websites/portals for registering for the vaccine, each with their own problems. Many have poor design or technical difficulties and we found that the most at-risk people like the elderly can't figure out how to register. We decided to make a single site where we would collect links, tips, comments specific to each county/location in the US and have it all in one place.
