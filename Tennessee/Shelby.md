Shelby County [vaccination updates](https://www.shelby.community/covid-19-vaccine/)

The Shelby County Health Department receives limited quantities of COVID-19 vaccines from the State of Tennessee on a periodic basis. As such, there is no surplus of vaccine supply at this time. In the coming weeks and as larger vaccine quantities become available, they will offer surplus supply to individuals who join the Shelby County VaxQueue. Additionally, as we move through the vaccine phases (as determined by the State Health Department), they will notify those individuals in the VaxQueue who may qualify to register for an appointment.
